# Theorist

COMING IN 4 DAYS 
-------------
**Theorist** is a powerful and lightweight math library for Roblox, designed to enhance your development workflow by providing advanced mathematical functions beyond Roblox’s default `math` library. Built and maintained in VS Code, Theorist is structured for performance, readability, and ease of use.

## Features
- **Euler’s Constant (`e`)** – Access Euler’s constant (`2.71828`) directly for exponential calculations.  
- **Factorials** – Compute factorials of integers efficiently.  
- **Wave Animations** – Simplified functions for creating smooth oscillating animations.  
- **Extended Math Utilities** – Additional functions to simplify complex calculations commonly needed in Roblox projects.  

## Installation
1. Download or clone this repository into your Roblox project or download the Roblox model soon in links.
2. Place the `Theorist` module in `ReplicatedStorage` or `ServerScriptService` for global accessibility.
3. Require the module in your script:
   ```lua
   local Theorist = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Theorist)
   ```

## Upcoming Features
- Comprehensive documentation (release planned in **4 days**)
- Additional advanced math functions (combinations, permutations, logarithms)
- Optimized performance for real-time game environments
